/// I originally solved this day's challenges by hand, but have also written the solution in code,
/// for posterity.
///
/// # Solution explain:
///
/// The formula for the distance a boat will travel is simple:
/// d = s * (T - h)
/// where d is the distance travelled, s is the speed of the boat, T is the total race time, and h
/// is the time that the button was held for. Since the speed of the boat is identical to the time
/// that the button was held for, s can be replaced with h and the formula can be rearranged to the
/// following:
/// h^2 - T * h + d = 0
/// We know the minimum distance the boat must travel, and the total race time, so the only unknown
/// is h. Clearly, this is a quadratic function, and, thus, can be solved via the quadratic
/// formula.
/// h = (T Â± sqrt(T^2 - 4 * d) / 2)
/// This will give us the minimum and maximum hold times required to win the race. From there, all
/// we need to do is subtract the minimum from the maximum and we have calculated the total number
/// of ways of winning the race.
